<Info>
  **Base URL:** `https://api.laozhang.ai/v1/chat/completions`
  **API Version:** `v1`
  **Service Status:** Running | **No Watermark** | **No Invitation Code Required**
</Info>

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    Log in to [laozhang.ai console](https://api.laozhang.ai) to obtain your API key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Billing Mode">
    Edit token settings and choose one of the following billing modes (same price for both):

    - **Volume Priority** (Recommended): Uses balance billing first, automatically switches when balance is insufficient. Suitable for most users
    - **Pay-per-call**: Direct deduction for each call. Suitable for strict budget control scenarios

    <Note>
    Both modes have **exactly the same price** at \$0.15/call (10s or 15s), only the billing method differs.
    </Note>

    <Warning>
    If billing mode is not configured, API calls will fail. You must complete this configuration first!
