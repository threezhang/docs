**Model Simplification Notice**

Due to official OpenAI's insufficient computing power and severe quotas, -hd (high definition) and -15s (15-second) versions are temporarily unavailable. They will be re-launched once computing resources are sufficient.

Currently only two highly stable models are available for selection.
