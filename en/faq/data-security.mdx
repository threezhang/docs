## Data Security Commitment

LaoZhang API is committed to protecting your data security and privacy, implementing industry-leading security measures. We are dedicated to providing secure and reliable AI technical API integration services.

## Cross-Border Data & User Responsibility

### Data Transmission Statement

As a **technical API integration service provider**:

- **Data Flow**: User requests are forwarded through our API to the corresponding model service providers
- **Transmission Role**: We only provide technical transmission channels, without processing, analyzing, or storing data content
- **Neutral Position**: We do not decide what data to transmit or interfere with data content

### Core Positioning (3 Key Points)

<Info>
**Technical Service Positioning Statement**

1. Data is uploaded at the customer's own discretion
2. We do not process, store, or analyze data content
3. We only provide technical API transmission capabilities
</Info>

### User Responsibility & Compliance Terms

<Warning>
**Important Legal Statement**

By using this service, users confirm and agree:

1. **Data Authorization Confirmation**: Users confirm they have the right to transmit relevant data to overseas model service providers and bear their own data compliance obligations
2. **Data Legality**: Users confirm that the data they upload and process does not contain personal information or sensitive data that violates applicable laws and regulations, or that they have obtained necessary authorization according to law
3. **Platform Positioning**: This platform only provides technical API integration services and does not analyze, store, or reuse customer data
4. **Risk Assumption**: Compliance risks arising from customer data content or cross-border data transmission are borne by the customer

This platform is not responsible for the legality of user data or compliance with cross-border data transmission.
</Warning>

## Technical Architecture Assurance

This platform ensures data security at the technical architecture level:

<Card title="What We Explicitly Do NOT Do" icon="shield-xmark">
**Technical Level Guarantees**

- **No Prompt Log Retention**: We do not save user request content
- **No Content Caching**: We do not cache any input or output data
- **No Model Fine-tuning**: We do not use user data to train or fine-tune models
- **No User Data Analysis**: We do not perform any form of analysis on user content

**Only Metadata Recorded**:
- Token counts (for billing)
- Call timestamps
- Interface type and model name
- Response status codes
</Card>

<Info>
This technical architecture design fundamentally ensures that we are "technically unable to process user data content."
</Info>

### Recommended Usage

<Tip>
**Safe Usage Recommendations**

1. **Data Desensitization**: Desensitize sensitive information before transmission
2. **Internal Use**: Prioritize use for enterprise internal systems and development testing
3. **Compliance Assessment**: Complete internal compliance assessment before production use
4. **Authorization Confirmation**: Ensure authorization to use and transmit relevant data
5. **Avoid Sensitive Data**: Do not upload personal sensitive information, trade secrets, or other protected data
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Not Recommended Usage**

- Direct transmission of raw data containing personal identification information
- Commercially sensitive data without desensitization
- Third-party data without authorization
</Warning>

## Core Security Measures

### End-to-End Encryption

<Info>
**TLS 1.3 Encrypted Transmission**

All data transmissions use **TLS 1.3 protocol encryption** to ensure data security during transmission:

- Latest encryption standard providing strong security protection
- Prevents data theft or tampering during transmission
- End-to-end encryption from user to server
</Info>

### Minimized Data Storage

**Technical Transmission Channel Positioning**

Core advantages of LaoZhang API as a technical API integration service:

- **No Request Content Storage**: Does not save your API request content (input and output)
- **No User Data Viewing**: Technical team cannot view specific conversation content
- **Immediate Deletion**: Content data cleared immediately after request processing
- **Privacy First**: Maximum protection of user privacy

<Tip>
**Why Choose Minimized Storage?**

As a technical API integration service, our responsibility is to securely and efficiently forward requests, not to store user data. This design fundamentally protects your privacy and security.
</Tip>

### Limited Logging

**Basic Log Scope**

We only record essential information for billing and troubleshooting:

- **Model Name Used**: For billing and service statistics
- **Token Length Statistics**: Input and output token counts
- **Request Timestamps**: For log analysis and troubleshooting
- **Response Status**: Success or error status records

<Warning>
**Explicitly Not Recorded**

- Specific conversation content
- User input text
- AI output responses
- Image or file content
- Personal identity information
</Warning>

### Short-Term Log Retention

**7-Day Retention Policy**

<Card title="Log Retention Period" icon="clock">
**Retention Period: Only 7 Days**

Considerations:
- **Data Security**: Reduce data breach risk
- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize storage resource usage
- **Privacy Protection**: Minimize data retention time
- **Compliance Requirements**: Comply with data protection regulations
</Card>

After 7 days, all log data is automatically deleted and cannot be recovered.

## Access Control Mechanisms

### Strict Permission Management

**Authorized Access System**

- **Least Privilege Principle**: Only authorized technical personnel can access logs
- **Anonymization**: Accessed log data has been anonymized
- **Necessity Review**: Access only when necessary for troubleshooting
- **Operation Records**: Complete audit logs for all access operations

### Technical Team Management

- **Background Checks**: Technical personnel undergo strict background investigations
- **Confidentiality Agreements**: Sign strict data confidentiality agreements
- **Regular Training**: Receive data security and privacy protection training
- **Permission Rotation**: Regular rotation and review of access permissions

## Security Assurance System

### Regular Security Audits

**Continuous Security Improvement**

<Info>
**Security Assessment Content**

LaoZhang API team regularly conducts comprehensive security assessments:

- **System Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular checks for system security vulnerabilities
- **Code Security Review**: Review potential security risks in code
- **Infrastructure Inspection**: Assess server and network security
- **Process Optimization**: Continuously improve security management processes
</Info>

### Compliance Assurance

**Regulatory Compliance Commitment**

- **Data Protection Regulations**: Strict compliance with GDPR, CCPA, etc.
- **Industry Standards**: Comply with technical service industry security standards
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Cooperate with relevant regulatory audits
- **International Standards**: Reference ISO 27001 and other international security standards

## Security Best Practices

### User-Side Recommendations

<Tip>
**Recommendations for Enhanced Security**

1. **API Key Management**
   - Regularly rotate API Keys
   - Don't hardcode Keys in code
   - Use environment variables to store sensitive information

2. **Sensitive Information Handling**
   - Avoid including sensitive personal information in requests
   - Use desensitized data for testing
   - Handle trade secrets carefully

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS protocol to access API
   - Use services in a secure network environment
   - Keep client software updated
</Tip>

### Platform-Side Assurance
