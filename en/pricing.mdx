### Billing Mode Priority

LaoZhang supports two billing modes. When a model supports both modes simultaneously:

<Warning>
  **Per-call billing takes priority over token-based billing**
  
  If a model supports both per-call and token-based billing, the system defaults to per-call billing.
</Warning>

#### API Key Settings Impact

Your billing method is also affected by token configuration:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Token-based Only" icon="sliders">
    If token is set to "token-based only", even if the model supports per-call billing, it will use token-based billing
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Default Settings" icon="circle-check">
    Tokens support all billing modes by default, system auto-selects (per-call priority)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## 💸 Token Billing Explanation

### What are Tokens?

<Card title="Understanding Tokens Quickly" icon="coins">
  Tokens are AI's "vocabulary units", the basic unit for billing.
  
  **Simple Memory**:
  - 🇨🇳 1 Chinese character ≈ 2 tokens
  - 🇬🇧 1 English word ≈ 1 token
  - 📝 500 Chinese characters ≈ 1000 tokens
  
  **Real Examples**:
  - "你好世界" = 4 tokens
  - "Hello World" = 2 tokens
  - A WeChat article (2000 characters) ≈ 4000 tokens
</Card>

### Actual Consumption Examples

| Use Case | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total | Cost (gpt-4.1-mini) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Simple Q&A | 20 | 50 | 70 | $0.00004 |
| Write an article | 100 | 2000 | 2100 | $0.0013 |
| Code Debug | 500 | 300 | 800 | $0.00027 |
| Long text translation | 5000 | 5000 | 10000 | $0.0035 |

### Prompts and Completions

In each API call, costs consist of two parts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prompt - Input Tokens">
    All content you send to the model, including:
    - System prompts
    - User questions
    - Context information
    - Chat history (if any)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Completion - Output Tokens">
    Content generated by the model, including:
    - Text responses
    - Code generation
    - Structured data
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Input and output prices may differ between models. Typically, output tokens cost more than input tokens.
</Warning>
