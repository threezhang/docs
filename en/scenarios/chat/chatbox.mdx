### Privacy Protection

Chatbox AI adopts a "privacy by design" philosophy:
- Data stored locally, not uploaded to cloud
- Supports self-hosted API endpoints
- Can be used completely offline (with local models)

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom API Endpoints

In addition to basic chat functionality, you can also configure dedicated image generation endpoints:

#### Chat Completion Endpoint Configuration
```yaml
Basic Chat Configuration:
  Provider Name: Laozhang API
  API Mode: OpenAI API Compatible
  API Key: sk-your-laozhang-key
  API Host: https://api.laozhang.ai/v1
  API Path: /chat/completions
```

#### Image Generation Endpoint Configuration

**Method 1: Use Dedicated Image API**
```yaml
Image Generation Configuration:
  Provider Name: Laozhang API-Image
  API Mode: OpenAI API Compatible
  API Key: sk-your-laozhang-key
  API Host: https://api.laozhang.ai/v1
  API Path: /images/generations  # Standard image generation endpoint
  Applicable Models: gpt-image-1, flux-kontext-pro
```

**Method 2: Use Responses Endpoint**
```yaml
Responses Configuration:
  Provider Name: Laozhang API-Responses
  API Mode: OpenAI API Compatible
  API Key: sk-your-laozhang-key
  API Host: https://api.laozhang.ai
  API Path: /v1/responses  # Universal response endpoint
```

<Tip>
**Endpoint Selection Recommendations**
- Regular conversation: Use `/chat/completions` endpoint
- Reverse image generation models like sora_image: Use `/chat/completions` endpoint
- Image generation: Prioritize `/images/generations` standard endpoint
- Special needs: Can use `gpt-image-1` or `/v1/responses` endpoint
- In Chatbox, the "API Path" field corresponds to the specific endpoint path
</Tip>

### Network Proxy Settings

If you need to use a proxy to access:
1. Go to Settings > Network Configuration
2. Configure HTTP/HTTPS proxy
3. Set proxy authentication (if needed)
