## Recommended Model Selection

Cline supports multiple large language models. Here are model recommendations for different programming scenarios:

| Programming Scenario | Recommended Model | Reason |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Quick Code Completion** | `gpt-3.5-turbo` | Fast response, economical |
| **Complex Algorithm Development** | `gpt-4-turbo` | Strong reasoning ability |
| **Code Refactoring** | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Good at long context understanding |
| **Documentation Writing** | `gemini-2.5-pro` | Strong text generation ability |
| **Bug Analysis** | `gpt-4-turbo` | Excellent problem-solving ability |

<Tip>
**Model Selection Suggestions**
- **Daily coding**: Recommend using `gpt-3.5-turbo`, lower cost
- **Complex projects**: Recommend using `gpt-4-turbo`, better quality
- **Long code files**: Recommend using `claude-sonnet-4`, supports larger context
</Tip>

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Code Completion

Cline can automatically complete code based on context:

- **Variable and function name suggestions**

### 3. Code Generation

Describe your requirements, Cline can generate corresponding code:

```
"Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci sequence"
"Create a React component for user login interface"
"Generate a SQL query to find top 10 best-selling products"
```

### 4. Refactoring Suggestions

Cline can analyze your code and provide:
- Code structure optimization suggestions
- Performance improvement solutions
- Best practice recommendations
- Security issue warnings

### 5. Test Generation

Automatically generate unit tests:
- Support multiple testing frameworks

- Provides usage examples
```

### Scenario 2: Code Review

```markdown
User: Please review this function

Cline:
- Analyzes code logic
- Identifies potential bugs
- Suggests performance optimizations
- Points out security risks
- Provides improved code examples
```

### Scenario 3: Learning New Technologies

```markdown
User: How to use React Hooks?

Cline:
- Explains Hook concepts

```

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "cline.apiProvider": "openai",
  "cline.baseUrl": "https://api.laozhang.ai/v1",
  "cline.apiKey": "Your Laozhang API key",
  "cline.model": "gpt-4-turbo",
  "cline.maxTokens": 2000,
  "cline.temperature": 0.7
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```json
{
  "cline.apiProvider": "openai",
  "cline.baseUrl": "https://api.laozhang.ai/v1",
  "cline.apiKey": "Your Laozhang API key",
  "cline.model": "gpt-4-turbo",
  "cline.maxTokens": 4000,
  "cline.temperature": 0.7,
  "cline.enableAutoComplete": true,
  "cline.enableCodeLens": true,
  "cline.enableInlineCompletion": true,
  "cline.autoTriggerDelay": 300
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Unable to connect to API

**Solutions**:
1. Check if Base URL is correct: `https://api.laozhang.ai/v1`
2. Verify API Key validity
3. Check network connection
4. Confirm firewall settings

### Response Timeout

**Problem**: Request timeout

**Solutions**:
1. Switch to a faster model (e.g., from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5)
2. Reduce maxTokens setting
3. Check network speed
4. Try during off-peak hours

### Inaccurate Suggestions

**Problem**: Code suggestions don't meet expectations

**Solutions**:
1. Provide more detailed descriptions
2. Include necessary context information
3. Try different models
4. Adjust temperature parameter

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Requirements

Provide clear and specific requirements:
```
❌ "Write a function"
✅ "Write a Python function that accepts a list of numbers and returns average, with type hints"
```

### 2. Provide Context

Include necessary code context:
```
❌ "Optimize this code"
✅ "This is a user authentication function, needs performance optimization, code: [paste code]"
```

### 3. Iterative Improvement

Don't expect perfect results at once:
1. Get initial code
2. Test and identify issues
3. Provide feedback
4. Iterate improvements

### 4. Security Awareness

Avoid including sensitive information:
- Don't paste API keys
- Don't share database passwords
- Don't upload internal business logic

### 5. Cost Control

Reasonably control usage costs:
- Use lighter models for simple tasks
- Limit maxTokens setting
- Avoid unnecessary repeated calls
